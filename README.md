This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

It uses [tachyons](https://tachyons.io/), a functional CSS helper. It is an amazing CSS standardiser. I did not have to write any CSS, except for moving animations.

#### Inspired by:
[Material UI's Mini Variant App Drawer](https://material-ui.com/components/drawers/#mini-variant-drawer)

But I did not want to use Material UI because the package is heavy and the app drawer seems hard to configure.

The gallery of music artists is a [vinyl gallery component](https://tachyons.io/components/collections/vinyl/index.html) provided by tachyons.

Reflections
-------------------

I realised there's a problem with state management that I have not considered. I would like to use Redux to solve the global state management problem. The learning curve is steep.
